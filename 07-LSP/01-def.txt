Deep Dive Into Liskov Substitution Principle

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), is the third principle in the SOLID acronym, 
which represents five principles of object-oriented programming and design. 

The principle's formal statement is:

"If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S 
without altering any of the desirable properties of that program."

In simpler words, derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes. 
That is, a program that uses a base class must be able to substitute a subclass without 
affecting the correctness of the program.
