Q - Is Singleton class exmaple is thread safe?

✅ What your code does

Your code ensures:

Only one instance of Singleton is created per runtime (in a single JavaScript execution context, 
    like one Node.js process or browser tab).

The _value is shared across all references because it’s static.

So from a logical perspective — yes, it behaves as a singleton in JavaScript/TypeScript.


❌ But is it thread-safe?

No, it’s not thread-safe — and here’s why:

1. JavaScript (and TypeScript) is single-threaded by default

Normally, in environments like:

Node.js

Browser

there’s only one thread executing code (the main event loop).
So “thread safety” isn’t an issue — because no two threads can call getInstance() exactly at the same time.

However…

2. When using Worker Threads or Cluster mode in Node.js

Each worker runs in a separate memory space (a separate process or thread).
That means:

Each worker will have its own copy of this Singleton class.

So you’ll not have a truly global Singleton across threads or processes.

You’ll end up with multiple singleton instances (one per worker).

3. No locking mechanism

Your code:

if (!Singleton.instance) {
    Singleton.instance = new Singleton();
}

is not atomic.
If two threads (say, two workers) could execute this at the same time, they might both see 
instance as undefined and create separate objects.

✅ When is it “safe enough”?

✅ In a browser or single-threaded Node.js app, yes — it’s effectively safe.

❌ In a multi-threaded environment (e.g., Node.js worker threads, clustered apps) — not thread-safe.



🧩 If you really need a thread-safe singleton (Node.js workers)

You’d need some inter-process synchronization (e.g., shared memory or IPC):

Use a message-passing approach (like the worker_threads module’s parentPort).

Or persist the singleton state in a shared resource (like Redis, file, or database).
